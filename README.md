# Leap Learn: Internship Endeavors

Hi there, and welcome to Leap Learn. All of the projects in this repository are intended to be finished within the next six months. We have carefully curated a collection of diverse and comprehensive projects that cover various topics and skills. We have something for everyone to enhance their knowledge and expertise. Get ready to embark on an exciting learning journey with Leap Learn and make the most of the next six months to acquire valuable skills and complete these enriching projects.

## Projects
- Variables, Data type, Operators and Console.write/read
  -   Develop a basic c# console application that computes and shows the grade entered by the user.
  -   Develop a basic C# console application that computes and shows the CGPA entered by the user.
- Loop and Array
  -   Create a c# console application that employs conditional statements to convert scores into corresponding letter grades.
  -   Develop a c# application utilising the necessary loop structure(s) to showcase the smallest number among 10 inputted numbers.
  -   Create a C# console application that converts a given number into its corresponding English name, limiting the range from 0 to 
      1000.
- Method
  - Write a method that returns the english name of the last digit of a given number example: for 512 prints "two", for 1024 prints 
     "four".
  -  Write a method that finds how many times certain number can be found in a given array. Write a program to test that the method 
      works correctly.
  -   Write a program that calculates and prints the n! for any n in the range [1…100].
  -   Write a method that calculates the product of two polynomials with integer coefficients, for example  (3x^2 + x - 3) * (x - 1) = (3x^3 - 2x^2 - 4x + 3)
- Objects
  - Write a program which calculates the area of a triangle with the following given:
      - three sides;
      - side and the altitude to it;
      - two sides and the angle between them in degrees
  - Write a program, which prints on the standard output the count of days, hours, and minutes, which have passes since the computer is 
    started until the moment of the program execution. For the implementation use the class Environment.
- Exception handling
  - Write a program that takes a positive integer from the console and prints the square root of this integer. If the input is negative 
    or invalid print "Invalid Number" in the console. In all cases print "Good Bye".
  - Write a method ReadNumber(int start, int end) that reads an integer from the console in the range [start…end]. In case the input 
    integer is not valid or it is not in the required range throw appropriate exception. Using this method, write a program that takes 
    10 integers a1, a2, …, a10 such that 1 < a1 < … < a10 < 100.
- Strings
  - Write a program that checks whether the parentheses are placed correctly in an arithmetic expression. Example of expression with 
    correctly placed brackets: ((a+b)/5-d). Example of an incorrect expression: )(a+b))
  - Write a program that extracts from a text all words which are palindromes, such as ABBA", "lamal", "exe".
  - Write a program that reads a string from the console and prints in alphabetical order all letters from the input string and how 
     many times each one of them occurs in the string.
- Data sructures and algorithm
  -    Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element 
       is distinct.
       - Example 1:Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
       Output: true,
       - Example 2:Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
       Output: false,
       -  Example 3:Input: nums = [1,1,1,3,3,4,3,2,4,2]
       Output: true
  - Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string. A word is a maximal substring 
    consisting of non-space characters only.
     - Example 1:Input: s = "Hello World"
       Output: 5
       Explanation: The last word is "World" with length 5.

     - Example 2:Input: s = " fly me to the moon "
       Output: 4
       Explanation: The last word is "moon" with length 4.
       
     - Example 3:Input: s = "luffy is still joyboy"
       Output: 6
       Explanation: The last word is "joyboy" with length 6.
  - Reverse array of integers
    - Return [3,2,1]
      Complete the function  in the editor below.
      has the following parameter(s):
       - : the array to reverse
      - : the reversed array
-  Object oriented programming principles
    - Define a class Human with properties "first name" and "last name". Define the class Student inheriting Human, which has the 
     property "mark". Define the class Worker inheriting Human with the property "wage" and "hours 
     worked". Implement a "calculate hourly wage" method, which calculates a worker’s hourly pay rate based on wage and hours 
     worked. Write the corresponding constructors and encapsulate all data in properties
    - We are given a school. The school has classes of students. Each class has a set of teachers. Each teacher teaches a set of 
    courses. The students have a name and unique number in the class. Classes have a unique text identifier. Teachers have names. 
    Courses have a name, count of classes and count of exercises. The teachers as well as the students are people. Your task is to 
    model the classes (in terms of OOP).
- SOLID principles
  - Implement Solid principles in c#
